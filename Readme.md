# Snake Game for a PIC18F45K22
---
__A prototype of a Snake game made for a PIC18F45K22 microcontroller__

>Will be modified to work with a screen instead of sending a data via 
>serial communication.

### Bill of Materials
>Here is a list of components I used to run this project. Values for 
> a potentiometer and resistors may be changed with a respect of 
> proportions.

* _PIC18F45K22 Microcontroller_
* _10k Potentiometer_
* _MAX232N and DB9 to USB Connector_
* _4 Active low Pushbuttons_
* _Latching switch_
* _One 4.7K立, one 500立, one 1K立, and 4 330立 Resistors_
